Endpoint detection/response tools (EDR). Security analysts often want to dig deep into security alerts by monitoring and investigating host behavior, so EDR (i.e. CarbonBlack, Countertack, CrowdStrike, Guidance Software, etc.) is an essential component of SOAPA.

Incident response platforms (IRPs). Aside from collecting, processing and analyzing security data, cybersecurity professionals want to prioritize alerts and remediate problems as soon as possible. These requirements are giving rise to IRPs such as Hexadite, Phantom, Resilient Systems (IBM), ServiceNow and Swimlane. 

Network security analytics. SIEM’s log analysis and EDR host behavior monitoring are complemented by flow and packet analysis in SOAPA, provided by vendors such as Arbor Networks, Blue Coat/Symantec, Cisco (Lancope) and RSA.

UBA/machine learning algorithms. While these tools have received an inordinate degree of industry hype, there’s little doubt that machine learning will be baked into security analytics henceforth, thus vendors such as Bay Dynamics, Caspida (Splunk), Exabeam, Niara, Sqrrl and Varonis should be included in SOAPA. 

Vulnerability scanners and security asset managers. Part of security operations is knowing which alerts should be prioritized. These decisions must be driven by solid data from vulnerability management systems (i.e. Qualys, Rapid7, Tanium) and other tools that monitor the state of systems and network configurations (i.e. RedSeal, Skybox, Verodin, etc.).

Anti-malware sandboxes. This technology represents another key pivot point for understanding targeted attacks that may use zero-day malware. Sandboxes from FireEye, Fidelis and Trend Micro are definitely part of SOAPA. 
Threat intelligence. Enterprise organizations want to compare internal network anomalies with malicious “in-the-wild” activities, so SOAPA extends to threat intelligence sources and platforms (i.e. BrightPoint (ServiceNow), FireEye/iSight Partners, RecordedFuture, ThreatConnect, ThreatQuotient, etc.).
